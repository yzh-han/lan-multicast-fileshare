# CS4105 Coursework P2 - Discover and Download

# This specification is not quite(!) in ABNF format, as defined in:
#   RFC5234(S) https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234
#
# I have taken some practical shortcuts for ease of implementation (as you
# will see). By referring to specific parts of the Java API, and using
# some informal definitions, the specification can be implemented quicker.
#
# This specification describes only the control-plane protocol.
# There is no real user-plane protocol, only a file transfer.
#
# The control-plane protocol MUST be implemented on IPv6 multicast.
#
# For the user plane your application will connect on <server-port>
# (see below).
#
# For implementing a download file-transfer, TCP/IPv6 MUST be used.

## General message format

  <message> := ":" <header> ":" <payload> ":"

  <header> := <identifier> ":" <serial-number> ":" <timestamp>
    # Example of header, with all parts:
    #
    # saleem@my.host1.net:528491:20231011-174242.042

  <identifier> :=  uid "@" fqdn
    # uid as from Java's System.getProperty.("user.name")
    # fqdn as from Java's InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName();
    # Examples:
    #
    #    saleem@my.host1.net
    #    my-id@my.host2.net

  <serial-number> := *DIGIT
    # A non-zero, unsigned decimal number to help the sender identify / demux
    # responses to messages: this value is used by a server in responses.
    # Examples:
    #
    #  42
    #  101
    #  528491
    #
    # This could, for example, be a monotonically increasing number.


  # A <response-id> would be used in a response messages to match requests to
  # responses so that multiple requests can be outstanding to the same server.
  <response-id> := <identifier> ":" <serial-number>
    # <identifier> and <serial-number> as defined above.
    # In any responses, a response-id uses the values of identifier and
    # serial-number from the request. Examples below.

  <timestamp> := <year> <month> <day> "-" <hours> <minutes> <seconds> "." <milliseconds>
  <year> := 4DIGIT
  <month> := 2DIGIT
  <day> := 2DIGIT
  <hour> := 2DIGIT
  <minutes> := 2DIGIT
  <seconds> := 2DIGIT
  <milliseconds> := 3DIGIT
    # As from Java's SimpleDateFormat(new String("yyyyMMdd-HHmmss.SSS"))
    # year         has format yyyy, 4-digits.
    # month        has format MM, 2-digits with leading zero if required.
    # hour         has format HH, 2-digits with leading zero if required.
    # minutes      has format mm, 2-digits with leading zero if required.
    # seconds      has format ss, 2-digits with leading zero if required.
    # milliseconds has format SSS, 3-digits with leading zeros if required.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #  20240912-174242.042
    #  20241101-210000.000

## General payload format

  <payload> := <advertisement-message> / <search-message> / <download-message> 


#### ####
## R1: Discover -- Advertisement message

  <advertisement-message> := "advertisement" ":" <server-port> : <services>
    # Example of a complete advertisement message, with header:
    #
    #   :saleem@my.host1.net:528491:20231013-174242.042:advertisement:10123:search=true,download=false:

  <server-port> := *DIGIT
    # a non-zero, unsigned, 16-bit decimal number, on which this server
    # listens for incoming connections, an ephemeral port as allocated
    # by the OS when ServerSocket() is created.

  <services> := <service-name> "=" <service-status> "," <service-name> "=" <service-status>
    # The offered services and their capabilities.
    # Example:
    #
    #   search=true,download=false

  <service-name> := "search" / "download"

  <service-status> := "true" / "false"


#### ####
## R2: Search

  <search-message> := <search-request> / <search-response>

  <search-response> := <search-result> / <search-error>

  <search-request> := "search-request" ":" <search-string>

  # All searches should be matched using a case-insensitive, sub-string match.
  # The sub-string matches any part of the full logical path-name of the file.

  <search-string> = file-string
    # file-string is any group of characters that can be used for a
    # the substring match of a full logical path-name for a file.

    # Example of a complete search request, with header:
    #
    #   :saleem@my.host1.net:1001:20240912-170101.001:search-request:hello:

  <search-result> := "search-result" : <response-id> : file-string
    #
    # file-string is any group of characters that can be is the full
    # logical filepath for the logical filespace for your application.
    # The id and serial-number in the response should match that of the
    # request. For example, if the server srv@my.host3.net has the file:
    #
    #   /dir1/dir2/hello_world.txt
    #
    # Then a response to the search-request message above would be:
    #
    #   :srv@my.host3.net:1111:20240912-170112.123:search-result:saleem@my.host1.net:1001:/dir1/dir2/hello_world.txt:
    #
    # Note that the root, "/", here is the root_dir of the logical filespace
    # exposed via the application, and not the local unix root directory!
    #
    # Searches could generate multiple results, and these should be sent
    # in separate messages, but using the same response-id so they can be
    # matched to the same request.

  <search-error> := "search-error" ":" <response-id>
    # The serial-number in the response should match that of the request.
    # For example, if the server srv@my.host3.net does not have a match, then
    # a response to the example request would be:
    #
    #   :srv@my.host3.net:1001:20240912-170112.123:search-error:saleem@my.host1.net:1001:

## R3: Download
  <download-message> := <download-request> / <download-response>

  <download-response> := <download-result> / <download-error>

  <download-request> := "download-request" ":" full-logical-path-name-string
  # full-logical-path-name-string is any group of characters that can be is the full
  # logical filepath for the logical filespace for the application.
  # e.g., :user@my.host1.net:528491:20231013-174242.042:download-request:example.txt:

  <download-result> := "download-result" ":" content-length
  # content-length is a non-zero positive integer representing the size of a file in bytes.
  # e.g. :user@my.host1.net:528491:20231013-174242.042:download-result:2048:

  <download-error> := "download-error"
  # e.g. :user@my.host1.net:528491:20231013-174242.042:download-error:

## Extension: mFQDNS
  <mfqdns-messagee> := <mfqdns-query> / <mfqdns-answer>

  <mfqdns-query> := "mfqdns-query" ":" fqdn
  # e.g. :user@my.host1.net:528491:20231013-174242.042:mfqdns-query:my.host1.net:

  <mfqdns-answer> := "mfqdns-answer" ":" fqdn " ":" ttl " :" ipv6-address
  # ttl is a non-zero, unsigned decimal number to represent time (ms) to live
  # ":"s in ipv6 are escaped as "%3A"
  # e.g. :user@my.host.net:528491:20231013-174242.042:mfqdns-answer:60000:fe80%3A%3A1a2b%3A3c4d%3A5e6f%3A7g8h:
